Experiment-9: Implementation of Linear Search.

Problem Statement  : Write a C++ program to search an element in an array using Linear search.

Algorithm:
•	Start
•	Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[ ].
•	If x matches with an element, return the index.
•	If x doesn’t match with any of elements, return -1.
•	Stop



Analysis:
•	The sequential or linear search algorithm is very slow. This is because we need to compare the item with every element. 
•	 If the array is not sorted, linear search is the only solution.
