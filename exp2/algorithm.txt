EXPERIMENT 2:  Evaluation of postfix expression using C. 
 
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write a C program to evaluate a postfix expression by converting an expression from infix to postfix. 
  
ALGORITHM:  

Let, x be an arithmetic expression written in infix notation. This algorithm finds the equivalent postfix expression y. 

1. Push “(“onto Stack, and add “)” to the end of X.
2. Scan X from left to right and repeat Step 3 to 6 for each element of X until the Stack is empty. 
3. If an operand is encountered, add it to Y. 
4. If a left parenthesis is encountered, push it onto Stack. 
5. If an operator is encountered ,then: 
	Repeatedly pop from Stack and add to Y each operator (on the top of Stack) which has the same precedence as or higher precedence than operator. 
	Add operator to Stack. (End of If) 
6. If a right parenthesis is encountered ,then: 
	1. Repeatedly pop from Stack and add to Y each operator (on the top of Stack) until a left parenthesis is encountered. 
	2. Remove the left Parenthesis. (End of If) (End of If)
