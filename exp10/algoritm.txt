Experiment-10: Implementation of Binary Search.


Problem Statement: Write a C++ program to perform Binary Search.


Algorithm:
•	Start
•	Compare x with the middle element of the sorted array. 
•	 If x matches with middle element, we return the mid index. 
•	Else If x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in right half subarray after the mid element. So we recur for right half.
•	 Else (x is smaller) recur for the left half
•	Stop


Analysis::

•	The given Array has to be a sorted array, specifically increasing order.
•	It reduces the search time nearly to half, compared to the Linear search.
•	Binary search is implemented using Recursion.
