EXPERIMENT 7:
Implementation of Bubble Sort

Problem Statement:
Write a C++ program to arrange the given set of numbers in ascending order using Bubble sort.

Algorithm:
1	Starting with the first element(index = 0), compare the current element with the next element of the array.
2	If the current element is greater than the next element of the array, swap them.
3	If the current element is less than the next element, move to the next element. Repeat Step 1.


Analysis:
The main disadvantage of the bubble sort method is the time it requires. With a running time of O(n^2), it is highly inefficient for large data sets.
