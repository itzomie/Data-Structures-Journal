Title: Implementation of Search operation in Binary tree Using C++.

Problem Statement: Write a C++ program to implement the search operation in Binary tree.

Algorithm:

•	Whenever an element is to be searched, start searching from the root node

•	Then if the data is less than the key value, search for the element in the left subtree. 

•	Otherwise, search for the element in the right subtree. 

•	Follow the same steps for each node


ANALYSIS (LIMITATIONS): 

1. Slower insertion/deletion of elements. 

2. Not a great choice for linear trees (degenerate tree - more or less a sorted linked list)
