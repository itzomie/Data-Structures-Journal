Title: Conversion from Prefix to Postfix Expression Using Recursion.

Problem Statement: Write a C++ program to convert a prefix expression into postfix expression using recursion.

Algorithm:

1.	Read the Prefix expression in reverse order (from right to left).

2.	If the symbol is an operand, then push it onto the Stack.

3.	If the symbol is an operator, then pop two operands from the Stack
	Create a string by concatenating the two operands and the operator after them.
	string = operand1 + operand2 + operator
	And push the resultant string back to Stack.

4.	Perform the above steps recursively until end of Prefix expression.
