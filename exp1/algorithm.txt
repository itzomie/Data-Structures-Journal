Implementation of stack using C

Algorithm:
1.	Create the stack by declaring the array of fixed size.
2.	Initialize the top variable to -1 to indicate the top of the stack.
3.	I) For push operation, first increment the top variable by 1 so that it points to next empty location.
        Store the value entered by the user into the index top.
        II) For pop operation, first return the value from index top and then decrement the top variable.
