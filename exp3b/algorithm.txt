Title: Fibonacci Sequence Using Recursion in C++.

 Problem Statement: Write C++ program to generate Fibonacci sequence using recursion.

Algorithm:

1.	Read the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence from user.

2.	Starting from 0 till the number of terms minus 1 call the function fib() which calculates the Fibonacci of the number and display the Fibonacci of that number.

3.	In fib function,

	1)	If the number is 0 or 1 return the number as it is.
	2)	If number is other than 0 or 1 then call the fib() function recursively as per the equation 
		fibterm=fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)
	3)	Return the fibterm.

Analysis/Limitations: 
There are following limitations of above implementation. 
Time Complexity: We can observe that this implementation does a lot of repeated work. So this is a bad implementation for nth Fibonacci number
