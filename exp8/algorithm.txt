EXPERIMENT 8

IMPLEMENTATION OF QUICKSORT

Problem statement:

Write a C++ program to arrange the given set of numbers in ascending order using Quick sort.

Algorithm:

•	Pick the first element as pivot element.

•	Now all the elements smaller than pivot are placed at its left while elements bigger are placed at right.

•	Repeat the above two steps recursively for both halves.

Analysis:
•	Quick Sort is not adaptive. 
•	On sorted data, Quick Sort devolves to O(n^2) performance. 
•	It is not stable. It is less than ideal for highly repetitive data. 
•	It's not always fast or ideal, although for the AVERAGE case, it's acceptably efficient in time and memory. 
•	On sorted data for large N, it's 15–16 times SLOWER than Bubble Sort
