Title: Factorial Using Recursion Using C++.

Problem Statement: Write a C++ program to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

Algorithm:

1.	Read the number and declare the variable fact to store the factorial of the number.

2.	We know that the factorial of a number n is fact(n)=n*fact(n-1)
        Where, n is the number 
        fact means factorial.

3.	The above equation acts as base condition.

4.	First check if the number is equal to zero if zero return the value 1
        If not zero then call the function recursively according to the equation n*fact(n-1).

5.	Return the variable fact.


5. Analysis/Limitations: 
There are following limitations of above implementation. 
Disadvantages of recursion: 
•	Fairly slower than its iterative solution. 
•	For each step we make a recursive call to a function.
•	May cause stack-overflow if the recursion goes too deep to solve the problem. 
•	Difficult to debug and trace the values with each step of recursion.
